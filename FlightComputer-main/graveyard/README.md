This is the respository for a redimentory flight control computer I will make as my final project.

4/23 project status report.
I have gained a general understanding of using pygame and pymunk 
I have added an angle of attack function which then goes into a lift function for the plane
I will use an off set force to control the pitch of the aircraft. 
the magnatude of the off set force will be proportinal to the airspeed and the input strength

this will simulate a realistic control surface for my PID loop
i will get done with the plane simulation tonight 

after that i will just need a way to measure the change in angle of the craft and relate that to the commanded change in angle in the PID loop 

the PID program will take this information and dictate how much I deflect the control surface to stabalize the craft

I will probably finish that by monday

It would probably be best to meet with my mentor once I am done with the first iteration. My most recent changes to github tonight.
